        I spent 7 years working with end users as a librarian, then later as a
        social media manager/customer service person, helping people from all
        walks of life, listening to and solving their various issues.

      <p class="paragraph-mobile-small xl:paragraph-regular">
        I believe in thorough research and the thoughtful consideration of
        design, to create easy-to-use, not annoying, human-centred solutions.

        I have currently 8 years of experience as a translator and 4 years as an editor. During this time I’ve learned that every word counts. In translation, as well as in UX, it’s important to say more with less and to say the right things.

        Despite my generalist mindset, I am an advocate for clear UX writing and good localization.

        I have almost 4 years of experience with working from home (8 years if you count the time I was a freelancer while having a full-time job), and I know how much discipline it requires to get things done despite the distractions.

      <p class="paragraph-mobile-small xl:paragraph-regular mb-0">
        I prefer remote or hybrid work, but the daily rhythm of going to the office can also be enjoyable, especially if it involves some good music or a good book on my Kindle.
