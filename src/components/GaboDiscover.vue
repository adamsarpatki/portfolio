          First, I did some <b>secondary research</b> online â€” since there
          aren't many academic publications about the effects of the pandemic on
          TTRPGs, this step mainly consisted of reading some informal articles.
          I'm a part of the subculture I wanted to target with my app, so I've
          had some pretty solid ideas about the changes brought about by
          COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
          Second, I conducted <b>primary research</b> in the form of
          <b>user interviews</b>. My goal was to learn about how casual players
          (i.e. people who do not make their living by playing and streaming the
          game) used existing digital tools for D&D 5e during game sessions. I
          wanted to learn about their current behaviors, pain points, and needs.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
          I've prepared a quantitative survey as well, but due to the tight
          deadlines of Udacity's course, I didn't have the chance to conduct a
          study before moving on to ideation and the second part of the diamond.
          This is something that I will have to go back to and finish.
