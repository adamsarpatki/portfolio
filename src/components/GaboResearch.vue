            First and foremost, I opened up GABO Online and <b>started taking
            screenshots, while using the site as a user would, from start to
            finish</b>. I’ve even bought a book to see how the checkout process
            ended. Next, on my Miro board, I’ve highlighted all the issues I

          <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
            Next, I facilitated quite long (1.5-2hrs) and detailed <b>usability
            testing sessions over Zoom</b> to find out what other people’s pain
            points and needs are when encountering this webshop. These sessions
            started with a <b>short user interview</b>, where we talked about how
            participants shop online in general, what kind of books they like,
            from where they buy them etc., then we started <b>testing the site,
            from sign-up to checkout.</b>

          <h5 class="h5-bold mb-4 mt-6 text-gray-900">Participants</h5>
          <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
            I recruited <b>6 participants between the ages of 29-35</b>. According to
            them, they are confident online shoppers, but never, or almost never
            use their mobiles or tablets to buy something. They have quite
            different needs when it comes to buying books. <b>4 participants
            weren’t familiar with GABO/Ciceró/Akkord, and 2 participants had
            only an inkling about them — and none of them used this online shop
            previously.</b>
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
            I should mention it, one of the participants was a fellow UX/UI
            designer, and I was afraid her feedback won’t be as usable as the
            others, since it’s inevitable that a designer will look at a site
            differently than a regular user. However, even though she mentioned
            a lot of small details (good and bad), I was happy when other
            participants mentioned those too. So I kept her insights in my
            research notes.

            After the interviews, I watched the recordings and gathered quite a
            lot of insights, then arranged them on a Miro board to better
            synthesize them, using <b>affinity mapping</b>. It took a long time, but it
            was a necessary step.

            With the tasks I’ve given to participants, I wanted to follow a

            steps as well.

          Customer Service
        </h5>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
          One thing I didn’t tackle in this project was the issue of contacting the publishing group. After checking their websites and socials, there seem to be <b>4 e-mail addresses and 4 phone numbers a customer can use to contact them, and GABO Online has a Contact Page with a contact form, that has two options</b>: one if you want to write to the customer service, and one if you want to write to the publishers. However, this contact page doesn’t have every phone number and e-mail address listed. And, interestingly, there are contact details in the site’s footer as well.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
          The <b>participants</b> of the usability tests were also confused about this, although they only saw the footer and the Contact Page due to the scope of the tests. They also <b>mentioned how much better it would be if the Contact Page contained at least a phone number, an e-mail address, some info about when to expect an answer</b>, and they also felt the contact form wasn’t very intuitive, <b>some of its functions didn’t work at all</b> (like selecting a previous order, even though we were using a live account with very current previous orders — this hasn’t been fixed yet, as of March 26, 2022).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
          I think 4 e-mail addresses and the same amount of phone numbers, a Contact Page and several social media pages should be more than enough channels for people to contact GABO, Ciceró or Akkord. So, in a way, that’s good. You can definitely reach them somehow. However, <b>I would examine if this amount of contactability is really necessary</b>. Depending on how the publishing group is structured (and that’s something beyond my knowledge), having only one e-mail address and one phone number, combined with a better Contact Page could be enough. E-mails can be sorted behind the scenes, calls can be redirected, and <b>customers would probably not be confused if they only had one or two options to choose from</b>.

          Prioritisation
        </h5>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
          Having a lot of insight is good, however, it soon became overwhelming. I didn’t know where to start with my design. So <b>I’ve prioritized the main issues about the site</b> using <a href="https://maze.co/guides/usability-testing/results/" target="_blank" class="text-link">a technique I’ve read about on Maze</a>: I sorted my summary post-its into <b>five categories, ranging from critical issues to no issues</b>. For some reality check, I’ve asked the help of one of my developer friends, which turned out to be a good thing — some issues were more serious than I thought and vice versa.

            While working on affinity mapping, <b>I’ve examined the websites of 4 competitors</b>: Libri, Bookline, Líra and Agave Könyvek. I’ve analysed their home page, sign-up/sign-in process, checkout process, search and filtering options, product page, footer, and - if they had the option - how they handled requests for out-of-stock books. During this process, I once again took an abundance of screenshots, then used post-its to highlight positive and negative elements on each page, just like I did when analysing GABO Online at the beginning.

          <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
            Neither of them is perfect, but each of them has some interesting solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
            Next, I listed out the commonalities of these sites, to, once again, help me in my redesign. These 4 competitors are quite popular, especially Libri, Bookline and Líra — they mostly sell books published by them and by hundreds of other publishers, while Agave is a smaller but still popular publishing house, and their shop only sells their products, so I thought it provided a nice addition, as being somewhat similar to what GABO Online is.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">
            In short, <b>I’ve assembled their commonalities to have a more detailed list of what might be expected by or familiar to users on these kinds of e-commerce sites</b>.

            If I had access to GABO’s real users, <b>I would have run an online survey about their shopping habits</b>, to find out their needs and pain points, especially since the group’s target audience is so wide — this step shouldn’t be missed if someone starts to redesign and rebrand GABO Online.
