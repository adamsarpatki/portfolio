         Even though I’ve designed and developed my own website, I count this project as my first full-blown website design, with lots of moving parts and small details that needed attention. I enjoyed the process, and I think I was successful in redesigning GABO Online for the better (thankfully, my usability test participants expressed the same view). I’m sure I missed a bunch of things I never thought about, and will only remember them once I publish this case study for everyone to see, but that’s okay.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">I’ve learned that website design is an incredibly complex job, these 4.5 months were a true marathon, especially as a team of one. But it was also enjoyable, and I’ve learned that sometimes it’s good to take a step back and try something again after a few days had passed, that way a solution might be instantly obvious.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">There were some things that I was thinking about doing, like creating an empathy map, or a user journey map, but in the end, I didn’t spend time on them, because for this project I felt they weren’t necessary. Yes, they would have been deliverables, but did I really need them? No. I had no stakeholders to persuade or help. This is another thing I’ve learned: just because the process says you need something it doesn’t mean you have to do it if ultimately you won’t get closer to your goal.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">I’ve also come to the conclusion that only doing something because your gut tells you to, or because you think “I just like it this way” is not enough. There needs to be a balance between instinct — which you will probably develop with experience — and well-formed reasons.</p>
                                <p class="paragraph-mobile-small desktop:paragraph-regular">I like reading about best practices while sketching or even prototyping, to find out, for example, what the best location is for CTAs on a form. Most of the time, I have assumptions, but it’s always better to find out how others solved a certain question, or if there are standards I should follow. However, a lot of the time there are just too many options and explanations. And I often feel like I could or even should write a separate case study for each little decision I make. So these things were a bit overwhelming during this project. But I’m sure this feeling will kind of go away as I gain more experience.</p>
