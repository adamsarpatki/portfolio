          First, I did some <b>secondary research</b> online â€” since there
          aren't many academic publications about the effects of the pandemic on
          TTRPGs, this step mainly consisted of reading some informal articles.
          I'm a part of the subculture I wanted to target with my app, so I've
          had some pretty solid ideas about the changes brought about by
          COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          Second, I conducted <b>primary research</b> in the form of
          <b>user interviews</b>. My goal was to learn about how casual players
          (i.e. people who do not make their living by playing and streaming the
          game) used existing digital tools for D&D 5e during game sessions. I
          wanted to learn about their current behaviors, pain points, and needs.

          (As a side note, I've prepared a quantitative survey as well, but due
          to the tight deadlines of Udacity's course, I did not have the chance
          to conduct a study before moving on to ideation and the second part of
          the diamond. This is something that I will remedy in the future.)
