      <div class="px-3 pl-8 pr-4">
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          In recent years Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) became more popular than
          ever. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became impossible for players
          of tabletop RPGs to meet in person — this made online gaming even more
          popular than before. People started playing on Zoom or Discord, and
          the number of users of virtual tabletops skyrocketed.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          So that got me thinking. Since most everyone in the hobby — including
          my own gaming group — used online, or at least digital tools to play
          at the time, that had to come with its own set of problems. I knew I
          have had those, so why wouldn't others have them, too?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          I have decided to focus on an area that I've always found problematic.
          <b
            >Dungeons & Dragons has such extensive rules, that I think it's
            often quite hard to find what one's looking for, especially during
            game sessions.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          So I set out to see what opportunities and needs might exist for new
          products aimed at D&D players.

        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          D&D Rulebook is a new mobile app for D&D players. In its most basic
          form, users can access the official rules of the game, both in a
          browsable, more book-like format (for casual reading between game
          sessions), and also with the app's built-in search functionality,
          using keywords and free text. The search function will also be able to
          find related entries in unofficial resources, like Sage Advice or RPG
          Stack Exchange. Furthermore, users can save their search results to
          their customizable FAQ.

          First, I did some <b>secondary research</b> online — since there
          aren't many academic publications about the effects of the pandemic on
          TTRPGs, this step mainly consisted of reading some informal articles.
          I'm a part of the subculture I wanted to target with my app, so I've
          had some pretty solid ideas about the changes brought about by
          COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          Second, I conducted <b>primary research</b> in the form of
          <b>user interviews</b>. My goal was to learn about how casual players
          (i.e. people who do not make their living by playing and streaming the
          game) used existing digital tools for D&D 5e during game sessions. I
          wanted to learn about their current behaviors, pain points, and needs.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          (As a side note, I've prepared a quantitative survey as well, but due
          to the tight deadlines of Udacity's course, I did not have the chance
          to conduct a study before moving on to ideation and the second part of
          the diamond. This is something that I will remedy in the future.)

          With this in place, my next step was to sketch some ideas, first by
          using the <b>Crazy Eights</b> method, then by creating
          <b>a very low-fidelity prototype</b> in Figma. I’ve iterated on it a
          few times, then conducted some usability studies, and iterated a few
          times, again, cleaning up some of the UI to better represent its
          intended functionality.

          Needless to say, this changed tremendously over each iteration,

          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-regular">
            For the design system, I've created color styles, a typography

            have made changes to the color scheme, using WebAIM, to give more

        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          I have started to rework my design system. Some of my adjustments only
          meant reorganizing things, e.g. labeling elements differently, while
          others meant revamping buttons, fields, the tab bar, and the nav bar —
          to follow Apple's guidelines more closely. This remained a continuous
          process as I started working on other areas of the app.

          Redesigned the Browse screen experience to be more like a table of
          contents, and be more compact and usable even with a large amount of
          reading material. For this, I went back to my low-fidelity prototype
          to first create a simplified version.

      <div class="pr-4 mt-2">
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          The previous version didn't follow Apple's guidelines very closely,
          and I had to figure out a better way to handle keywords and search
          results from multiple sources. I opted for table views to do this —
          it's a solution that's native to iOS, and is capable of presenting
          large amounts of list-style information.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          The new "Selected keywords" section's height would be fixed, making it
          so that the user can add only 3 or 4 keywords — this is something I
          haven't specified in earlier versions. Since keywords would have an
          AND relation between them, combined with the free-text search, it
          should be more than enough.

          Swapped out the icon of the Browse screen from “building blocks” to an
          “open book”, indicating that it’s a more book-like function. Added
          labels to the icons of the tab bar.

        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          Designing D&D Rulebook from start to finish was a thoroughly
          enjoyable, but not always easy process. It taught me a lot about the
          process of user-centered design, about the value of proper research
          and user testing, about listening to one's guts, and not being afraid
          to change something if it results in a better product.

      <div class="px-3 pl-8 pr-4">
        <p class="paragraph-regular">
          I’m not done with this project yet. It still needs a lot of work and a
          lot of testing until I am willing to say it’s finished (as much as a
          project like this can ever be finished). However, I am confident that
          should I have the necessary resources to make it more than just a
          concept, it would solve a lot of problems for D&D players.
